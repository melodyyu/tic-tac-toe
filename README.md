# Tic-Tac-Toe
This repo holds the project for implementing, training and running a game of Tic-Tac-Toe by utilizing reinforcement learning algorithms. It is done so as the second project for the course COGS182: Reinforcement Learning at UC San Diego.  

## Execution 
To run this code, simply git clone the file into your local environment. Open the Jupyter notebook and run all cells. 

Note: the cell on the bottom of the file is partially unrun because I stopped termination mid-way after realizing that including it did not have much merit. Attached is a screenshot of how it would look when run. This cell allows for user input so that a human player could interact with the agent and act as its opponent.
